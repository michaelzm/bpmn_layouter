# BPMN Layouter

## Overview
BPMN Layouter is a Python-based tool that processes BPMN XML files, converts them into structured JSON, and appends position data to the elements.

## Features
- Converts BPMN XML to structured JSON
- Flattens JSON into a dictionary for easy manipulation
- Builds a tree structure of BPMN elements
- Computes and assigns element positions
- Writes back positional data to XML
- Encapsulated in a `BpmnLayout` class for simple usage

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michaelzm/bpmn_layouter.git
cd bpmn_layouter

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Running the Code
To process a BPMN XML file and generate a positioned file, use the `BpmnLayout` class as follows:

```python
from xml_string import xml_file_3
from bpmn_layouter import BpmnLayout

# Instantiate and generate layout
bpmn_layout_generator = BpmnLayout()
bpmn_layout_generator.generate_bpmn_layout(xml_input_file=xml_file_3, xml_output_name="generated_xml_file")
```

### Input
- **BPMN XML File:** This should be stored in `xml_string.py` as `xml_file_3`.

### Output
- **generated_xml_file.xml**: The processed XML file with added positional data.
